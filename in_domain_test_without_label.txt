``

In

some
people
familiar
with
the

question
whether
the
court
will
act
by
January
as
forecast
by
Mr.
Lorenzo
and
Mr.
Bakes
.

And
after
weeks
of
delay
,
the
appropriations
process
is
beginning
to
take
some
final
shape
.

The

which

charge

,
is
considered
an
early
signal
of
changes
in

policy

Mr.

told

During

Nixon

the
Drug
Enforcement
Administration
became
dismayed
at
the
extent
of
the
G-2

connections
to
arrested
drug
traffickers
.

A
House-Senate
conference
approved
an

67

fiscal
1990

bill
that
provides
a
28
%
increase
for
space
research
and
development
and
incorporates
far-reaching
provisions
affecting
the
federal
mortgage
market
.

While
the
U.S.
share
of
the
increase
probably
will
not
reach
the
$
12
billion
or
more
implicit
in
the
IMF
's
request
for
a
doubling
of
its
$
90

,
the
administration
probably
will
agree
to
a
multibillion-dollar
increase
.

The
consensus
from

is
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
advise
major

In

were
bidding

mounted
that

Final

Yet
it

also
axiomatic
that
the

But
most
experts
agree
that
the
concept
that
is
to
be
introduced
drags
in
great
complexity
;
they
have
been
trying
to
head
it
off
this
year
.

Mr.

The

.

On
Monday
,
the
company
,

,
reported
a
wider
fiscal
fourth-quarter

predicted

for
its
fiscal
1990
first
quarter
,
but
said
a
profit
is
expected
for
all
of
fiscal
1990
.

They
're
just
as
confused
.
''

That
trend
,
and
Wells
Fargo
's
heavy
exposure
to
leveraged
buy-outs
,
are
about
the
only
worries
analysts
have
about
Wells
Fargo
's
financial
picture
.

Some
of
those
debtholders
have
filed
a
suit
,
saying
they

they

``
We

to
take
the

But
most
are
linked
by
a
single
theme
:
liquidity
--
the
ability
to
get
in
and
out
of
the
market
quickly
.

In

Mr.

has
approached
a
number
of
his
suppliers
and
asked
them
to
provide
letters
of
intent
saying
they
will
continue
shipping
merchandise
to
the
chain
following
the
buy-out
,
say
those
familiar
with
the

.

Coca-Cola
Enterprises
,
which
is
49%-owned
by
Coca-Cola
Co.
,
also
said
it
repurchased
about
1.2
million
of
its
common
shares
during
the
third
quarter
.

The
results
were
in
line
with
analysts
'
expectations
.

Most
analysts
think
there
's
little
prospect
the
Contras
can
be
a
significant
fighting
force
without
U.S.
arms
,
and
after
the
February
election
their
future
in
any
form
will
be
murky
at
best
.

Machinists
already
have
rejected
a
package
that
would
have
provided

raise
plus

Jeffrey

Stan
Hathcock
,

Last

``

The

margin
-
the
difference

The

the

Conceivably
,
in

Also
,
profit
was
hurt
by
the
strength
of
the

overseas

negatively
affected
the

But
other
analysts
contend
that
while
the
Fed
's
move
to
loosen
credit
has
n't
been
aggressive
,
it
nevertheless
sends
a
clear
signal
that
,
at
least
for
now
,
the
Fed
has
relaxed
its
grip
on
credit
.

Soon
after
the

plunged

Gold
,

has

risen
or
fallen
significantly
in

yesterday
achieved
what
may

over

to

Mr.

often
asked
almost
plaintively
how
the
Americans

whom
he
had
helped

so
many

could
turn
against

In
1960
,
for
example
,
when
Mr.

was
both
a
cadet
at
an
elite
military
academy
in
Peru

a
spy-in-training
for

U.S.

was

for
allegedly

savagely
beating

according
to
a
U.S.

from
that
period
.

When
the

it

The

of

rebounded
as
livestock

shook
off
fears
that

in
turn
would
hurt

The
results
met

,
who
had
already
slashed
their
projections
after
the
company
said
in
late
August
that

In

the

tried
to
supply

whether
the
tipper
had
breached
his
fiduciary
duty
to
the
corporation
in
order
to
obtain
``
some
personal
gain
''
and
whether
the
tippee
knew
or
recklessly
disregarded
this
fact

She
called
her

The

flared

recent

propelled
it

that

last

would
recommend

of
Section
89
.

Public
protests
against
him
were
triggered
in
June
1987

to
charges
by

Herrera

that
Mr.

had
stolen
the

be
against
the
public
interest

criminal

well
established

now
